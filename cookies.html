    <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
    <p>ecolie respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data. 
        We use cookies on our website (the “Website”) for certain limited purposes. 
        This policy explains how cookies are used on the Website. 
        The policy may be amended from time to time. When we do,
         we will post the revised policy on this page on the Website with a new “Last Updated” date.</p> <br>

        <H4>What are cookies and how do we use them?</H4>
        <p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you browse 
            websites that can recognize you when you revisit and remember certain information about you. 
            This can include pages you have visited, choices you have made from menus, any specific
             information you have entered into forms, and the time and date of your visit. 
            These cookies allow us to distinguish you from other website users, 
            which helps us to enhance the user’s experience and improve our Website functionality.</p> <br>

            <p>We use cookies in connection with our Website for limited purposes. 
                Some cookies are necessary for technical reasons, and some enable a personalized experience for both visitors and registered users.
                 Cookies may also allow us to gather data about our Website,
                 such as the number of visits, most visited pages, etc. Cookies also help with the following:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Make our Website work in a more user-friendly way;</li>
                <li>Analyze how well our Website and services perform;</li>
                <li>Understand, improve and research features and services, such as the speed and security of our Website;</li>
                <li>Help you fill out forms on our Website more easily; and</li>
                <li>Allow you to share pages with social networks like Facebook.</li>
                
                <p>We do not use cookies to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Collect any personally identifiable information (without your express permission);</li>
                    <li>Collect any sensitive information (without your express permission);</li>
                    <li>Pass data to advertising networks;</li>
                    <li>Pass personally identifiable data to third parties; or</li>
                    <li>Pay sales commissions.</li>
                </ul>
              <p>Our Website uses three types of cookies to improve the functionality of our site 
                and to deliver many of the features that make your browser experience more user-friendly.
                 These are described in more detail below.</p>
                 <h4>Our Own Cookies</h4>
                 <p>We use cookies in ways that help our Website function more effectively. These cookies tell us:</p>
                 <ul>
                    <li>Whether you have visited us before or are a new visitor; and</li>
                    <li>The pages you visits, which help us to understand which areas of the Website are of greatest interest to you.</li>
                 </ul>
                 <p>These cookies are required for the operation of our Website. If you do not want these cookies to be set, you should not access or use our Website for any purpose.</p>
                 <h4>Social Website Cookies</h4>
                 <p>Our Website contains links to Facebook, Twitter and other similar social media sites that enable you to “Like” or share the content of our website with other people via social media. When you use these “share” buttons, a third-party cookie is installed. The privacy implications on this will vary from social network to social 
                    network and will be dependent on the privacy settings you have chosen on these networks.</p>
                 <h4>Third-party Cookies</h4>
                 <p>In some special cases we also use cookies provided by trusted third parties. 
                    This Website uses Google Analytics, which is one of the most widespread analytics solution on the web for helping us to understand how you use the 
                    Website and ways that we can improve your experience.  
                    These cookies may track things such as how long you spend on the Website and the pages that
                     you visit so we can continue to produce engaging content.
                      This policy does not apply to and we are not responsible for the cookies used by Google Analytics. Note that you can opt out of Google Analytics without affecting how you visit our Website. 
                    For more information visit the Google Analytics cookies page.</p>

                    <p>Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” (DNT) signals to websites with which the user
                         communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature,
                         it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they are even aware of them. We currently do not change our tracking practices in response to DNT settings in your web browser.  </p>
                      
                         <h4>Granting us permission to use cookies.</h4>
                         <p>By clicking the “I agree” button or by continuing to use our Website after you have received this cookie notification,
                             you give us your permission to use cookies. However,
                              removing or changing settings may limit the accessibility and
                               functionality of our Website, which means that it may not work as you would
                                expect.</p>
                            <h4>More information about cookies.</h4>
                            <p>You can usually switch cookies off or disable or refuse to allow cookies by adjusting your browser settings. Doing so, however, might limit the accessibility and functionality of the Website. 
                                For more detailed information about cookies, including how to disable cookies, see <a href="https://allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org.</a></p>
                            <p>It may be that your concerns around cookies relate to so called “spyware.” 
                                Rather than switching off cookies in your browser 
                                you may find that anti-spyware software achieves the same objective by automatically 
                                deleting cookies considered to be invasive.</p>

                                <p>If you have any questions in relation to this policy, please contact info@ecoie.co.za.</p>
